            <p>Hi, I’m currently a first-year doctoral student in a third-year of an integrated master's-PhD program in the <a href="http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn/">College of Computer Science and Technology</a> at <a href="https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/">Xi'an Jiaotong University (XJTU)</a>, and expected to get the PhD degree in 2028. I’m co-advised by <a href="https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/web/wgwu">Prof. Weiguo Wu (伍卫国)</a> and <a href="https://www.buaa.edu.cn/bh2024/info/1028/1595.htm">Academician Depei Qian (钱德沛)</a>. Prior to that, I received my B.E. degree from the <a href="http://softschool.zzu.edu.cn/">School of Cyber Science and Engineering</a> in <a href="https://www.zzu.edu.cn/">Zhengzhou University (ZZU)</a>, Zhengzhou, 2022.</p>
            <p>My research interests mainly focus on compiler optimization, high-performance computing storage, parallel computing, and AI empowerment.</p>
